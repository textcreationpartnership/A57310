#####Body#####

1. A Standard of Righteouſneſſe lifted up to the Nations, and an Enſigne of Peace unto the People.

    _ ¶ A few words concerning man in his fallen degenerated eſtate from God, in which he hath not power to keep the Commands of God nor his Law, nor to do any work accoptable to him; but all his righteouſneſs is as filthy raggs, or as a menſtruous garment.

    _ Here followeth an Invitation of Love to all people, to come unto the Fountain of Fountain of Living Waters, which is now open, that they may drink and be ſatisfied, and never thriſt more.

    _ A Teſtimony concerning the ſpiritual man, who is begotten of God, through the spirit, by the Immortal Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever, and hath received the spirit of Adoption, whereby he cries Abba Father.

    _ Here is the way which leadeth to the Kingdome of God in ſhort, held forth to all who are willing to enter therein.

    _ The difference between the true Goſpel and the falſe, truly stated and clearly demonstrated; that all people may ſee and read which Goſpel they have received and obeyed this many years, whether the true Goſpel, or the falſe.

    _ Here followeth a few Queries put to Leonard Letchford, either to be anſwered by plain Scripture, according as I have anſwered his before cited, or elſe to acknowledge that I have ſtruck the Devil dumb in his miniſter at Hurſt at laſt, though I have long ſuffered him to boaſt himſelf as though he were a Miniſter of Chriſt, even till his fruits are grown ſo foul and odious that every one is ready to bring in their verdict to the contrary.
